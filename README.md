## Lab: Linked List Card Game

## What did we add?  What are the rules?
We added a simple game of War. The game shuffles the deck before drawing, with the player winning by obtaining a higher valued card than the computer.  All that is needed is to execute the code and follow the prompts in the terminal.

## What part uses the linked list
The parts using a linked list include the deck after shuffling and the player hands, added in case a more complex game was wanted
